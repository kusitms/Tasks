## Week1 Assignment

The objective is to make a Dataset using PyTorch and Pandas. Using the appropriate python type is encouraged. According to which type you make use of, your code can be under 10 lines, or can be more than a hundred lines.

# Let's get friendly with Git.

First, make a branch with your full name in this repository `Tasks`. For example, if your name is Piljae Chae, please set the branch name as piljaechae.

Then, clone the branch you have just created. The terminal command will be `git clone -b <YOUR NAME> git@github.com:kusitms/Tasks.git <THE FOLDER NAME YOU DESIRE>`

Then, at the place you typed the command, a new folder named THE FOLDER NAME YOU DESIRE shall appear. Change the skeleton code provided.

When the codes are changed, you now follow these procedures.

1. `git add <FILE YOU CHANGED>`
2. `git commit -m 'ANY MESSAGE YOU WANT TO LEAVE'`
3. `git push`

# What you have to do.
